## Why do sales people role play and practice

Role playing and practicing trains you to perform at your best when you're consulting or closing 
clients and salespeople that want to improve their conversion results are always involved in this activity. 
Role Play Tribe gives you the opportunity to do it anytime, anywhere and with an infinite pool of partners to choose from. 
By role playing and practicing you will dramatically improve your presentation and influencing skills, learn how to 
effectively respond to objections and how and when to speak spontaneously, so that you can direct the conversation 
to the outcome you're after. And the best part is that you can do this on your schedule with expertly selected role playing 
partners that will be pushing your skill level up.

## How is it done now

Well, when it comes to role playing around real estate sales conversations, usually the process of finding a role playing partner
looks something like this. You are likely to have a conversation with your broker manager about who in your office is interested
in role playing and ask him to connect you with them. After that you have a direct conversation with your potential partners
and try to establish your mutual role playing skill level. If that goes well and your selected partner has some calendar openings
to add you to their schedule, you schedule a few sessions to see if this is going to work out. After that you role play with your new
partner until there is nothing new to learn and your role playing sessions fizzle out. And remember this is the best case scenario.
You may not hit it off with this partner or your skills might end being at the opposite ends of the spectrum and that case you'd
need to start your search all over again. And just like with combat sports, practicing with one and the same partner all the time
is not going to give you the skills to feel comfortable in any sales situation. You need variety. Bottom line, there is a lot friction
in this process and you may quickly discover that finding even a hand full of skillful and reliable partners to role play with is an
insurmountable obstacle.

## How does Role Play Tribe help you with this process

based on your profile and guides you the process of scheduling role playing sessions with them. Once you complete a one-time
